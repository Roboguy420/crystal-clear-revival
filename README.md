# Crystal Clear Revival
A revival of the Crystal Project icon pack for XFCE. Originally designed by Everaldo Coelho for KDE, the Crystal Project's frutiger aero aesthetic gives a fresh and blissful look to the desktop. While most icon packs these days have a focus on sleekness, simplicity, minimalism, and flatness, the Crystal Project serves as a stark contrast to that, offering a bubbly style reminiscent of the early-to-mid 2000s, where hope and optimism for the future of technology was still high.

## Contribution
Now, let me get this out of the way: I am not an artist by any stretch of the imagination. My own personal attempts at adding to the beautiful work done by Coelho, quite frankly, would be an insult to his craft. If there are any icons within XFCE that do not have a fitting Crystal equivalent and you would like to submit your own one, please make a pull request with the image (preferably a PNG in each of the sizes too) and I will credit you in this readme section. Note that you will not receive payment for this, this is entirely voluntary as this is mostly a personal project of mine rather than anything to start putting money into.
